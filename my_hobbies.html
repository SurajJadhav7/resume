        <li><strong>Movies</strong>- I love movies. They make you think beyond your
            life and expands your point of view. I like movies in general,
            and Suspense Thrillers in particular. Some of my all time favorites are
            The beutiful mind, Ratsasan, Life is beautiful, The Shawshank Redemption,
            Masaan, Interstellar and many more. Check out this list of
            <a href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/">top rated movies</a>.

        <li><strong>Books</strong>- If smartphones weren't here, I'd have almost always a book in a hand.
            Though it's been very low frequency nowadays, I still read them. Some of
            my favorites are The valley of fear, The hound of baskervilles, The secret,
            Fire in the belly, Mrityunjay, Man's search for meaning
            <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/bestsellers/books">etc</a>.
